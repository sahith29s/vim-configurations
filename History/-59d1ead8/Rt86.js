FUNCTIONS PART -1

FUNCTIONS ARE SPECIAL TYPES OF RELATIONS BUTTONS ARE CALLED FUNTIONS BUTTON FAN BUTTON RELATION WITH FAN BUTTON MAPPPED WITH FAN 


one button only only with one instrument mapping is considered to be good

no extra buttons 

functions are special types of relation with follows some norms i.e., one button on mapping no extra button 

function  can be defined betwen two sets 

f : A --> B 

elements of A are called == Inputs (x)

elements of B are called == outputs ( y or f(x))
inputs only map with one and outputs maybe or maynot 

functions are mappings which maps each and every element of set A to give a unique element of set B 

not all relations are  functions but all functions are relations

y = x**2 
x input = indepenent variable 
y = output = dependent variable 
f(x) = f of x 

y = x**2
