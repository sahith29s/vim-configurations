What is force 

it is denoted by f 

vector addition

force is an vector quantity It has both magnitude and direction.

// eleration is the change in the velocity

Balanaced Force p net is zero 

force is the cause and accleration is the effect

if a body is at rest it will remain at rest and a bdoy with uniform motion will remain in uniform motion, until an external unbalanced force is applied.


It states that rate of change of momentum is  directly proportiaol to external unbalanced force applied on the body 

force is proportiaol to change in momentum per time 

force = delta p / delta t
