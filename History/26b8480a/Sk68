This is 6th 

|x| where is x is real number called modulus of x

|x +y(iotta)| is called magnitiude of complex number

| A vector | magnitiude of vector

| A matrix | determinant

| A set | cardinal number of set 

modulus accpets all the real number

| 2 | = 2 
| 0 | = 0 
| -2 | = 2

Domain = (-ve infnity , +ve infnity)

Range = [0, +ve infnity)


|-1 | = -(-1)

modulus don't let any negative output

x
