import express, { Request, Response, NextFunction } from "express";
const router = express.Router();

router.get("/", (req: Request, res, Response) => {
    res.json({ message: "Hello this is Vandor" })
})

const User = mongoose.model('User', UserSchema);

// Query for all users and execute the query with exec()
User.find({ age: { $gte: 18 } }).exec((err, users) => {
  if (err) {
    console.error(err);
  } else {
    console.log(users);
  }
});


In this example, User.find({ age: { $gte: 18 } }) defines a query to find all users with an age greater than or equal to 18. However, the query isn't executed until you call exec(), which is when the actual database operation takes place. The callback function passed to exec() is used to handle the results of the query.

Using exec() allows you to work with Mongoose queries in a more asynchronous and flexible manner, making it easier to handle database operations in Node.js applications.

what is regex
ChatGPT
"Regex" is a common abbreviation for "regular expression." A regular expression is a powerful and flexible pattern-matching language used for searching, extracting, and manipulating text based on patterns. Regular expressions are used in various programming languages, text editors, and other tools for tasks such as:

Search and Find: You can use regular expressions to search for specific patterns within a text string or document. For example, finding all email addresses in a text document or locating phone numbers in a string.

Validation: Regular expressions are often used to validate user input. For instance, you can use them to check if a given string is a valid email address, phone number, or URL.

Data Extraction: Regular expressions can be used to extract specific pieces of information from a larger text block. For example, extracting all the links from an HTML page or extracting data from a log file.

Text Manipulation: They are useful for text manipulation tasks like replacing text that matches a pattern with something else. This is commonly seen in search and replace operations in text editors or when processing data.

Parsing: Regular expressions can help in parsing structured data from unstructured text. For example, parsing data from a CSV file or breaking down a complex string into its component parts.

Regular expressions consist of a combination of characters and metacharacters that define a search pattern. Common metacharacters include . (matches any character), * (matches zero or more of the preceding character), + (matches one or more of the preceding character), ? (matches zero or one of the preceding character), [ ] (matches any character within the brackets), ^ (matches the start of a line), $ (matches the end of a line), and many more.

Here's a simple example of a regular expression in JavaScript to match valid email addresses:

javascript
Copy code
const emailPattern = /^[a-zA-Z0-9._-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,4}$/;
In this example, the emailPattern regular expression is used to validate email addresses. It checks for the presence of the "@" symbol, domain name, and a valid top-level domain (TLD).

Regular expressions can vary in complexity from simple patterns to very intricate ones, depending on the task they are designed to solve. They are a valuable tool for text processing and pattern matching in software development and data analysis.
