signum function 
f(x) = signum (x) or sgn(x)

Domain = (-ve infinity , +ve infinity)

Range = [-1, 1]



constant function 

f(x) = k where k is a constant 

Domain = (-ve inf, +ve inf)

Range = {k}




simple parabolic function
f(x) = x raised to power 2

range = [0, +ve inf )



polynomial functions

f(x) = 0  zero polynomial (degree is not defined)
f(x) = 5 (degree = 0)
f1(x) = x +3
f2(x) = x raised to power 2 + 6

power over should whole number 

only n is the degree when the cofficient is not 0

f(x) = 0  zero polynomial
