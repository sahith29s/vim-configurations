                        Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy
                        emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[33]

                        Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming
                        paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional
                        programming. It is often described as a "batteries included" language due to its
                        comprehensive standard library.[34][35]

                        Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC
                        programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[36] Python 2.0 was
                        released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting
                        garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008,
                        was a major revision not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python
                        2.7.18, released in 2020, was the last release of Python 2.[37]

                        CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors,
                        and fonts.[3] This separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and
                        control in the specification of presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share
                        formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, which reduces complexity and
                        repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to be cached to improve the page
                        load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.Separation of formatting and
                        content also makes it feasible to present the same markup page in different styles for different
                        rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen
                        reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. CSS also has rules for alternate formatting if
                        the content is accessed on a mobile device.[4]
