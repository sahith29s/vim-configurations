Acceleration should be constant 


Equations of motion

v = u + at 
s = ut + 1/2 a t square
v square = u square + 2as

u and v are not staring or ending speed it is the staring and ending of observation

s nth = u + a/2(2n  -1) displacement of object in nth second 

1s = o to 1
2s = 1 to 2

nth s= (n-1) to n
