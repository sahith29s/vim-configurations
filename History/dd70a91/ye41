Errors


no measurement is 100% accurate

parallel method is used for measuring large distance.
 

Estimation of very small Distance.
one ml of  oleic acid is mixed with 19ml alcohol = 20 ml substance

systematic Errors
(1) instrumental Errors
(2) Imperfection in experimental technique or procedure
(3) personal error (parallel error)

Random error 
on which we don't have any control 

Least count error
minimum reading that you can measure from the instrument 



Random error 
x1 x2 x3 ..... xn

xmean = (x1 + x2 ..... xn)/n

delta x1 = | xmean - x1|
.
.
.
delta xn = |xmean -xn|

delta xmean = (|xmean - x1| ..... |xmean -xn|)/n

x = xmean -+ delta x measuring

----------------------------xmean - delta xmean <= x <= xmean + delta xmean --------------------------

relative error franctional error = (delta xmean)/ xmean

%percentage error = (   (delta xmean)/ xmean *100)%
