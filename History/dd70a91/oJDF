Errors


no measurement is 100% accurate

parallel method is used for measuring large distance.
 

Estimation of very small Distance.

systematic Errors
(1) instrumental Errors
(2) Imperfection in experimental technique or procedure
(3) personal error (parallel error)

Random error 
on which we don't have any control 

Least count error
minimum reading that you can measure from the instrument 



Random error
