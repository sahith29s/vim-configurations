This is four

Logarithmic functions 

Inverse functinons of expontenatial functions are called logarithmic functions.


input of log cannot be zero

input of log cannot be negative
Domain = (0, infinity]
range = (-ve infinity , +ve infinity)
e = 2.718 (euler constant)

e = 1 + 1/1! + 1/2! + 1/3! ..... 1/infinity!

ln x = natural log
log 10 = common log
