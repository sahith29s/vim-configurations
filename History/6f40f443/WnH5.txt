RELATIOONS 




CARTESIAN PRODUCT OF TWO  SETS

ordered pair = (2,4) and (2.4) != (4,2)

unordered pair = 2,4

ordered pair (x, y) = (2, 4)

cartesian product

A x B = A cartesian B good (no: A multipilcation B)

A x B != B x A

n(Ax B ) = n(A) * n(B)

n(A x B) = n ( B x A )



if C x D = { } either c is null set or d is null set or both or  null set 

RELATIONS ARE GENERALLY DENOTED BY " R " 

relations will be defined between two sets
