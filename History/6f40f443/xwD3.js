RELATIOONS 




CARTESIAN PRODUCT OF TWO  SETS

ordered pair = (2,4) and (2.4) != (4,2)

unordered pair = 2,4

ordered pair (x, y) = (2, 4)

cartesian product

A x B = A cartesian B good (no: A multipilcation B)

A x B != B x A

n(Ax B ) = n(A) * n(B)

n(A x B) = n ( B x A )



if C x D = { } either c is null set or d is null set or both or  null set 

RELATIONS ARE GENERALLY DENOTED BY " R " 

relations will be defined between two sets 

A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

B = {1, 2, 4, 9 , 10}

relations can be defined with three methods roaster form , set builder, visual representation
R : A --> B


R = { ( a, b ) : a E A , }
preimages = first set which take part in relation
Images = from second set which take part in relation
preimages and images mapping 

Domain of relation 
D with subscript R1 = set of all the preimages 


Range of relation
R With the sub script of R1 = set of all the images 

co - Domain 
C0 = D with the subscript R1 = set of all the elements of second set or B set 

range is a subset of co domain and maybe be equal to co domain 


relations and cartesian product 


relation of A and B would be always be subset of A x B  ( A cartesian plane B)


if n(A) = p and n(B) = q 
then the total possible subsets = 2 raised to power p * q 


---------------------- number of relations that ca be possible with set A and set B are the 2 raise to power p * q ( to understand this see the before text) -------------------------------
